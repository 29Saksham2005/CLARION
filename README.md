# CLARION
CLARION builds on LED for long-document handling. After draft generation, we apply a fact-aware scoring mechanism to reduce hallucination, a redundancy penalty to control repetition, and a refinement loop to improve coherence. These are integrated into a multi-objective training loss, producing a balanced and more reliable biomedical summary.
